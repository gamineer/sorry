            <h2>Chapter 1: The First Hello ðŸŒ¼</h2>
            <img src="./p1.jpg" alt="Our first conversation">
            <p>We first saw each other on a video call â€” casual, unplanned. I remember trying to act a bit more polished than I usually am, maybe just wanting to leave a good first impression. That small interaction kickstarted something unexpectedly special: a bond that keeps growing.</p>

        <div class="chapter" id="chapter2">
            <h2>Chapter 2: The 31st Night</h2>
            <img src="./p9.jpg" alt="Shared love for books">
            <p>The New Yearâ€™s Eve party â€” 31st December. You were dancing like you owned the floor, and I was just soaking in the vibe. We danced, laughed, and enjoyed it all with my friends around. That night wasnâ€™t just the end of a year, but the beginning of many great memories between us.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter3">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Journey of Friendship</h2>
            <img src="./p3.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>When my holidays ended and I had to travel back to college â€” 26 hours on a train sounded like a nightmare. But then we started chatting. And chatting. Time slipped away like magic. It was the most memorable train journey of my life, all because of our never-ending conversation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter4">
            <h2>Chapter 4: Everyday Catch-ups</h2>
            <img src="./p8.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>Since then, not a single day has gone by without us talking. Whether it was a good day or a rough one, weâ€™d check in, share memes, talk about random things, or just send one-line updates. Youâ€™ve been one of the most consistent parts of my days â€” and that means something big.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter5">
            <h2>Chapter 5: Calls, Exams & Late Nights</h2>
            <img src="./p4.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>Video calls became our thing. Even during exam weeks, when time was scarce, I still tried to stay connected. You always brought comfort, laughter, and a pause from the chaos. Those moments reminded me how solid our friendship had become.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter6">
            <h2>Chapter 6: From Chats to Connection</h2>
            <img src="./p7.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>Somewhere between those texts and calls, we built something rare â€” a real friendship. One thatâ€™s fun, genuine, supportive, and easy. We could be silly, serious, or silent â€” and it never felt weird. It just worked.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter7">
            <h2>Chapter 7: That Two-Hour Meet</h2>
            <img src="./p2.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>After nearly 5 months, I finally got to meet you again. Two hours â€” and yet it felt so complete. Being around you again reminded me how much I missed your vibe in person. It was short, yes. But it left me smiling for days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter8">
            <h2>Chapter 8: When Things Got Distant</h2>
            <img src="./p5.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>Now, I know somethingâ€™s not right. I can sense the distance. I donâ€™t have all the answers, but I do know I never want to lose this friendship. Thatâ€™s why I made this. This whole page is my way of showing that I care â€” genuinely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter9">
            <h2>Chapter 9: The Little Things You Love</h2>
            <img src="./p6.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>Youâ€™ve always had that unique spark â€” your love for books, those rom-coms, talk shows like Koffee with Karan, your honest opinions, your mood swings. Itâ€™s all so you â€” and thatâ€™s exactly what makes you unforgettable as a friend.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter" id="chapter10">
            <h2>Chapter 10: This Friendship Matters</h2>
            <img src="./p11.jpg" alt="Jaishree's smile">
            <p>This isnâ€™t about fixing everything instantly. Itâ€™s just a small gesture â€” to say that this friendship means a lot to me. I value it. I value you. And I hope, through these chapters, you feel that too.</p>

                <p>My dear Jaishree,</p>
                <p>As I sit to write these words, I find myself at a loss - how does one capture the essence of a friendship that has meant so much in mere sentences?</p>
